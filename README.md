## Tic Tac Toe:

A simple Tic Tac Toe online game working with Java RMI. You can play with your friends remotely.  
Work only with two players.

### Known issues 
* The game can't be restarted (next party will be bugged if you try it)
    - **Workaround:** close server and client then restart both.
* Sometime, when a player clicks to add a symbol and if it's his turn, it can happen that the symbol dosen't appear (but symbol appear for other player). However, server will have taken into account the symbol, it's only a displaying bug.
    - **Workaround:** You can add a symbol at your next turn, the last and currently symbol will appear.
